## Introduction

As a data science enthusiast, I have been learning and practicing data science for several years. Along the way, I have accumulated a lot of useful knowledge, tips, and resources that I find helpful in my journey. This wiki serves as a place for me to organize and share my knowledge with others who are interested in data science.

## Features

This repository contains the following features:

- **Structured notes**: My notes are structured using Logseq's bullet point hierarchy, making it easy to navigate and organize.
- **Searchable**: You can easily search for keywords or topics using GitHub's search function.
- **Continuous updates**: I will continue to add new contents to this repository as I learn and discover new things in the field of data science.
- **Publish Github Page by Official Action**: [Logseq Publish SPA · Actions · GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/logseq-publish-spa)

## Why Logseq

### Move to Logseq from Tiddlywiki[^2]

I recently moved my personal data science wiki from Tiddlywiki to Logseq. While Tiddlywiki is a great tool, I found that Logseq better suits my needs for the following reasons:

- **Bi-directional links**: Logseq's bi-directional linking feature[^3] allows me to easily create connections between related notes and navigate through them seamlessly.
- **Zettelkasten Method**: The Zettelkasten method[^4] is a powerful note-taking technique that Logseq supports natively, allowing me to capture and connect ideas more effectively.
